    img: "alluvial_riv.png"
    info: "Alluvial rivers are the primary way in which sediment is transported
    from eroding source areas to deposition sinks. They aggrade, incise and 
    adjust their rates of sediment transport in response to changing environmental
    conditions. These processes can leave behind terraces along alluvial rivers
    and facies variations in sedimentary successions downstream. We are developing
    models and collecting field observations to build a coherent and quantitative
    understanding of this behaviour. Ultimately we hope to facilitate intepretation
    of these archives in terms of past environmental change. See

  - title: "Depths and temperatures of mantle melting"
    img: "meltpt.png"
    info: "The eruption of magma at volcanic centres is one of the clearest surface
    expressions of mantle convection in Earth's dynamic interior. However, many
    questions remain regarding how and why mantle melting occurs where and when
    it does. Useful information can be obtained by calculating pressures and
    temperatures of melting from the geochemistry of volcanic rocks. We developed
    a Python package, called
    <a href='https://github.com/fmcnab/meltPT'>meltPT</a>,
    for the application of major-element
    thermobarometers and for comparison between their results and predictions of
    geothermal models. See

- - title: "Mantle convection and Earth's surface landscape"
    img: "meltpt.png"
    info: "Convection deep in the Earth's mantle causes uplift and subsidence of
    the surface, but its influence is often subtle and difficult to discern
    from that of plate tectonic processes. One way to disesntangle these effects is
    to analyse the shape of the landscape, which reflects the combination of uplift,
    subsidence, and erosion. In particular, if erosion can be parameterised, we
    can infer uplift-rate histories across the continents. Away from plate boundaries,
    these results provide direct constraints on mantle-driven uplift. Close to plate
    boundaries, this information can be combined with independent evidence such as
    the timing and composition of volcanism to distinguish between different uplift
    mechanisms. See

  - title: "Ancient transient landscapes"
    img: "gcanyon.jpg"
    info: "Assessing the influence of mantle convection on the Earth's surface
    through geologic time is challenging since its effects are generally subtle
    and impermanent. An exception may be in shallow water continental basins,
    which, in the absense of geodynamic effects, slowly subside and accumulate
    sediment. If such basins are subjected to a phase of mantle driven uplift,
    they can become exposed, trigerring a phase of fluvial incision. On the
    resumption of steady subsidence, fluvial valleys are infilled and the
    transient landscape preserved, along with information about the amplitude
    and rate of uplift. Ancient landscapes can therefore provide rare insights
    into patterns of mantle convection in deep time. See
