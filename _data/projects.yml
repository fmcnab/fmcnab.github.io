    info: "Alluvial rivers are the primary way in which sediment is transported
    from eroding source areas to deposition sinks. They aggrade, incise and 
    adjust their rates of sediment transport in response to changing environmental
    conditions. These processes can leave behind terraces along alluvial rivers
    and facies variations in sedimentary successions downstream. We are developing
    models and collecting field observations to build a coherent and quantitative
    understanding of this behaviour. Ultimately we hope to facilitate intepretation
    of these archives in terms of past environmental change. See:

  - title: "Depths and temperatures of mantle melting"
    img: "meltpt.png"
    info: "The eruption of magma at volcanic centres is one of the clearest surface
    expressions of mantle convection in Earth's dynamic interior. However, many
    questions remain regarding how and why mantle melting occurs where and when
    it does. Useful information can be obtained by calculating pressures and
    temperatures of melting from the geochemistry of volcanic rocks. Although
    many variations on this approach have been proposed, there are few frameworks
    in which to apply and compare them in a consistent way. We developed a Python
    package, called meltPT, for the application of major-element thermobarometeres.
    See: McNab and Ball (2023) for an overview of the software and a case study
    on Hawai'i; McNab et al. (2018) for an earlier application to Anatolia."
