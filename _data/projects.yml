    info: 'Alluvial rivers are the primary way in which sediment is transported
    from eroding source areas to deposition sinks. They aggrade, incise and 
    adjust their rates of sediment transport in response to changing environmental
    conditions. These processes can leave behind terraces along alluvial rivers
    and facies variations in sedimentary successions downstream. We are developing
    models and collecting field observations to build a coherent and quantitative
    understanding of this behaviour. Ultimately we hope to facilitate intepretation
    of these archives in terms of past environmental change. See:
