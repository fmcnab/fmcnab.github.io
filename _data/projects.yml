    info: "Alluvial rivers are the primary way in which sediment is transported
    from eroding source areas to deposition sinks. They aggrade, incise and 
    adjust their rates of sediment transport in response to changing environmental
    conditions. These processes can leave behind terraces along alluvial rivers
    and facies variations in sedimentary successions downstream. We are developing
    models and collecting field observations to build a coherent and quantitative
    understanding of this behaviour. Ultimately we hope to facilitate intepretation
    of these archives in terms of past environmental change. See

    info: "The eruption of magma at volcanic centres is one of the clearest surface
    expressions of mantle convection in Earth's dynamic interior. However, many
    questions remain regarding how and why mantle melting occurs where and when
    it does. Useful information can be obtained by calculating pressures and
    temperatures of melting from the geochemistry of volcanic rocks. We developed
    a Python package, called
    <a href='https://github.com/fmcnab/meltPT'>meltPT</a>,
    for the application of major-element
    thermobarometers and comparison between results and predictions of geothermal
    models. See

    img: "gcanyon.jpg"
    info: "Assessing the influence of mantle convection on the Earth's surface
    through geologic time is challenging since its effects are generally subtle
    and impermanent. An exception may be in shallow water continental basins,
    which, in the absense of geodynamic effects, slowly subside and accumulate
    sediment. If such basins are subjected to a phase of mantle driven uplift,
    they can become emergent, trigerring a phase of fluvial incision. On the
    resumption of steady subsidence, fluvial valleys can be infilled and the
    transient landscape preserved, along with information about the amplitude
    and rate of uplift. Thus, ancient landscapes can provide rare insights into
    patterns of mantle convection in deep time. See
