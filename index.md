#### **My research**

I am interested in how surface, geodynamic and climatic processes combine and interact to shape Earth's surface landscape and geological record. In turn, I use observations from landscapes and landforms, as well as sedimentary and magmatic rocks, to infer information about past geodynamic and climatic environments. I apply a combination of numerical modelling, field observations and geochemical analyses. I am particularly interested in inverse modelling approaches seeking to find optimal model parameters that fit diverse surface observations. I am comitted to open and reproducible science and aim to develop and release generalised tools that can be used by the wider community. I currently work as a research scientist at the German Centre for Geoscience Research (GFZ) in Potsdam. You can read more about my current and past projects [here](https://fmcnab.github.io/projects) and find a complete list of publications [here](https://fmcnab.github.io/publications).

#### **Outside work**

I play hockey for a local club side, spend time in the outdoors (when I can), take photographs, and drink coffee.
